Outside of work I volunteer as (position one) with (volunteer company 1). It is through this experience that I have met many wonderful people and been able to gain a greater understanding of what I want my impact to be on the world. I know that (company name) holds similar values and I'm excited at the opportunity to pursue my volunteer activities in and outside of the workplace.
