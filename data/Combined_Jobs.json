What really matters is that it feels small. We work in small groups, each group has their own culture and vibe. And within those groups we work in teams, so working at Nedap feels a bit like working in a small company, but with big resources. The best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p>A little over fourteen years ago Nedap healthcare was born. Founded by a spirited individual that had an eye for simplicity and a drive for success, Healthcare&#39;s first product was a small time-tracking device for nurses with a single button. Hardware has always been in Nedap&#39;s DNA, evolving in the preceding eighty plus years from mechanical to electrical devices that started to include or be connected to more and more software.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, Nedap Healthcare builds mostly software, both for the web and mobile platforms. We help nurses, doctors, and patients manage their daily life by allowing them to focus on what is important.</p>\n\n<p>We are seeking a RoR engineer to tackle a complex migration project. Our core application has been built in Java and we have been slicing it into separate parts for a while now.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we have sliced away the front-end but we still rely on the Java app for most of the core data that drives the app. We retrieve this data using API calls. The next step is to access the data from within the RoR app without API calls (direct Mysql connection).</p>\n\n<p>The project will entail identifying the domain logic in the Java application (with our help) and moving that logic to Rails. The first step will keep the data storage in the \u2018old\u2019 datastore and access that database from within the Rails app. As a cherry on top, the RoR app is multi-tenant, but the old core app is single tenant.</p>\n\n<p>You need to be willing to temporarily re-locate to the Netherlands for the first leg of the project as you will need to interact with our engineers on the ground. After which the job can be continued remotely.</p>\n\n<p>Even though this is a single shot project, if all goes well there is room for you to join our team permanently if there is a good match.</p>\n\n<p>You need to have a very good grasp of Rails and Ruby but also be willing to dig into the old Java code to uncover the secret to what makes it tick. </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in helping us tackle this challenge please get in touch!</p>\n", "title": "RoR Engineer", "company_url": "https://nedap.homerun.co/", "company_name": "Nedap", "post_url": "http://jobs.github.com/positions/6f0bd4d0-fd64-11e5-9e4a-79d6b673f93a", "source": "GitHub Careers", "location": "Groenlo, The Netherlands", "apply": "<p>Please apply using the following job form:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nedap.homerun.co/ror-engineer-data-migration/en\">https://nedap.homerun.co/ror-engineer-data-migration/en</a></p>\n", "data_created": "Fri Apr 08 08:37:01 UTC 2016"}, {"full-time": true, "description": "<p><strong>Park Assist is looking for skilled C# .NET developers to work on our mission critical, high throughput, highly available web server application.

The parameters of these models are calibrated using several sensors present in the machine. The calibrations of the machine can be done offline in a dedicated calibration test, or inline while running production. Afterwards, the calibrated parameters are used to control the machine in such a manner that the inaccuracies are corrected.</p><br /><p>Your role is to design, realize and integrate high-quality software engineering solutions, allowing fast and efficient delivery of complex metrology functions.

But if you're interested, read on to see the big problem I am trying to solve.</p><br /><p>This isn&rsquo;t a job posting for someone who likes the 9-5 life and the safety of a regular paycheck.</p><br /><p>This is a posting for someone who wants to make a fundamental improvement in the life of millions of people. There are approximately 1.5 billion language learners in the world, but only 7-15% can claim fluency. That means there are more than 1 billion people who started a language but never got there.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re still reading and excited about the opportunity to promote foreign language literacy, you&rsquo;re probably who I am looking for.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The problem</strong></p><br /><p>I speak Vietnamese, English and Japanese. My language ability has opened many doors and allowed me to travel the world. But learning a language <strong>IS HARD</strong>. And now I want to give back by making it easier to master a language. <strong>A. LOT. EASIER.</strong></p><br /><p>Studying Japanese was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done. I have been studying for 7 years and at this point I still can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m fluent. I&rsquo;m stuck at the intermediate hump, where real-world content is too difficult and time-consuming to master and most edtech tools like Duolingo are too basic. After a long day at work, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to pick up a dense book full of characters that I don&rsquo;t even know how to put in a dictionary in the first place. Studying a language requires persistence, time and motivation, which come in rare quantity for people with work and personal responsibilities.</p><br /><p>35% of all language learners are at the intermediate level, meaning that there are more than 500 million people who are likely facing the same issue I have. The most motivated ones make it over the hump, but most don&rsquo;t.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><br /><p>I always wish I had a personal learning assistant, someone who would know my level and give me content that matches my current ability. Someone who would answer questions on the spot when I run into words or phrases I don&rsquo;t know. Someone who would give me daily quizzes to make sure that I retain what I&rsquo;m studying. That way, most of the time I spend studying is actually for studying, not fumbling around with a dictionary or flashcards.</p><br /><p>That is the product I want to make. Using machine learning and natural language processing, as well as some good old spaced repetition system, I want to create a product that serves as your personal learning assistant. Showing is better than telling, so here is what it looks like: <a href=\"http://www.helium-app.com/?utm_source=stackoverflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.helium-app.com/?utm_source=stackoverflow</a>. I don&rsquo;t want to make a cookie-cutter language app, I want to make a pedagogically-informed, intelligent and personalized learning app. This is the future of edtech.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The feedback</strong></p><br /><p>In about five days we&rsquo;ve had 500 completely organic signups and tons of positive feedback. The average conversion rate is 20% (having excluded the first day which was mainly friends and family signups). People need this!</p><br /><p>Here is one:</p><br /><p>&ldquo;My name is James and I'm more interested in Helium than the average person. I've been learning Chinese for years, and this is something I've always thought needed to be made. But on top of that, I'm a developer as well, and really appreciate the work you must be putting into this app. Right now I'm living in China still trying to improve my Chinese, and this app is basically exactly what I need. I have plenty of friends here studying for the HSK test that would absolutely love it as well.&rdquo;</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s in it for you</strong></p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, chances are the opportunity to create something from scratch with massive potential impact together with smart and passionate colleagues is what gets you going. In addition to that, I will give you equity, and a lot of it, to make this thing happen. I&rsquo;m committing my foreseeable future to this and just quit a very well-paid PM gig, and I want to make sure you do too.</p><br /><p>We can talk about a minimal salary to support your expenses, but there is nothing that says I&rsquo;m in like sipping ramen for months in exchange for a chunk of nothing that would be something when we make Helium a reality.</p><br /><p>Join Helium, and rise!</p>", "title": "Technical co-founder for a game-changing adaptive foreign language startup at Helium (Stanford, CA) (allows remote)", "company_url": "N/A", "post_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/114995/technical-co-founder-for-a-game-changing-adaptive-helium", "source": "StackOverflow Job Postings", "full_time": "N/A", "company_name": "Helium", "date_created": "2016-04-29T11:10:35Z", "apply": "how to contact and apply", "location": "Stanford, CA"}, {"description": "<p>We are looking for an experienced Full-Stack Developer to join our company made of 400 highly skilled modern craftsmen and -women.

Front end technology has changed in amazing and incredible ways. New stuff comes out each week. How it fits in has become more and more critical. We need you to help us build these awesome things.</strong></p><br /><p>What we're looking for is someone that will really dig working with us. Fit in well. You'll love coming to work, and we'll love working with you. What we're really interested in is you and your passion for developing and refining code. Please don't take that in a creepy or stalker kind of way.</p><br /><p>A little bit about us:</p><br /><ol><br /><li><strong> We're not consultants. </strong>We don't take on projects for a few weeks and then hand over (all the while knowing that this elegant yet fragile code will explode in Production). We get down and dirty, because we think that is where stuff gets really interesting. We value long term projects, because we know that by refining and iterating we can continually improve an idea. We have been working on some sites for over 10 years - but the job is never done.</li><br /><li><strong> We all work together.</strong> To work together as a high performing team, we think meaningful conversations and interactions are important. To make great digital things, so many different parts need to come together perfectly - from UX to DevOps.&nbsp;We are a team of about 30 people. Not too big, not too small. It&rsquo;s a collaborative, non-hierarchical ego-free workplace. You&rsquo;ll get to know everyone and have enough room to grow and never be pigeon holed.</li><br /><li><strong>We're not an ad agency &amp; we don't outsource.</strong> We build. We're pretty geeky, and while we have content, UX &amp; design people, we're undeniably technical. And to be technically good you need excellent processes along with a strong tech culture. People that care. We're not that company that seems to build things but actually gets all the work done in Nepal or Poland or wherever. Sure those teams could be great, but there are better things you could be doing with your career than babysitting an offshore team.

Testers at Animoto are strongly embedded within product teams and partner with developers to increase confidence in our software. We are not trying to break systems that developers hand us, we&rsquo;re working with developers to deeply understand and improve systems. Want to become an indispensable member of the engineering team? Read on...<br /><br /><br />Test, as an engineering discipline, seems unusually vulnerable to existential crises. Every organization has a different perspective on test function, goals and deliverables. So we feel that a job posting needs to be fairly opinionated in terms of how we view &ldquo;Test&rdquo; at Animoto.<br /><br /><br />Fundamentally, we believe TESTING IS ABOUT GETTING FEEDBACK FROM A SYSTEM. This is true whatever size of system we&rsquo;re talking about, and whether we&rsquo;re talking about a developer feeding inputs to a single function in console or a suite of automated UI tests running in the cloud. Testing is obviously not something that only testers do, but members of the Test Team are mostly focused on providing feedback and working on systems that can provide feedback.<br /><br /><br />We try to avoid talking about &lsquo;Quality Assurance&rsquo;. This might just sound like semantics, but all teams need to care about quality and no one team can truly assure it. We value Automated testing and Exploratory testing. We do not write or run manual test scripts.<br /><br /><br />Our SDETs are capable developers who recognize that Test provides some of the most interesting and challenging engineering opportunities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>WHY YOU WANT TO WORK AT ANIMOTO?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><span>You resonate with our Test philosophy and don't want to work anywhere that doesn't think about Test in that way.</span></li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><span>You want a chance to learn and grow as a Test Engineer. We encourage our testers towards deep understanding of the technologies and systems that they are testing.</span></li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><span>A powerful and cool product. We are a New York based tech company that strives to enable anyone to produce powerful, professional video.

We have over 14 million users, both consumers and businesses, a web-based video editor, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and integrations with various partners including Shutterfly. Animoto has been featured in the Apple store more than once, have contributed significant pieces to the Open Source community, and is a hub for the tech community workshops and meetups.</span></li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>WHY ANIMOTO WANTS YOU?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><span>You have a solid background in testing, automation and computer science fundamentals.

This new architecture will optimize the performance of a wide variety of applications through intelligent utilization of globally distributed resources and by transparently routing client work requests to the proper shards.&nbsp; This is an opportunity for you to join the team that is setting the new standard for massively scalable and available databases.
