But if you're interested, read on to see the big problem I am trying to solve.</p><br /><p>This isn&rsquo;t a job posting for someone who likes the 9-5 life and the safety of a regular paycheck.</p><br /><p>This is a posting for someone who wants to make a fundamental improvement in the life of millions of people. There are approximately 1.5 billion language learners in the world, but only 7-15% can claim fluency. That means there are more than 1 billion people who started a language but never got there.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re still reading and excited about the opportunity to promote foreign language literacy, you&rsquo;re probably who I am looking for.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The problem</strong></p><br /><p>I speak Vietnamese, English and Japanese. My language ability has opened many doors and allowed me to travel the world. But learning a language <strong>IS HARD</strong>. And now I want to give back by making it easier to master a language. <strong>A. LOT. EASIER.</strong></p><br /><p>Studying Japanese was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done. I have been studying for 7 years and at this point I still can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m fluent. I&rsquo;m stuck at the intermediate hump, where real-world content is too difficult and time-consuming to master and most edtech tools like Duolingo are too basic. After a long day at work, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to pick up a dense book full of characters that I don&rsquo;t even know how to put in a dictionary in the first place. Studying a language requires persistence, time and motivation, which come in rare quantity for people with work and personal responsibilities.</p><br /><p>35% of all language learners are at the intermediate level, meaning that there are more than 500 million people who are likely facing the same issue I have. The most motivated ones make it over the hump, but most don&rsquo;t.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><br /><p>I always wish I had a personal learning assistant, someone who would know my level and give me content that matches my current ability. Someone who would answer questions on the spot when I run into words or phrases I don&rsquo;t know. Someone who would give me daily quizzes to make sure that I retain what I&rsquo;m studying. That way, most of the time I spend studying is actually for studying, not fumbling around with a dictionary or flashcards.</p><br /><p>That is the product I want to make. Using machine learning and natural language processing, as well as some good old spaced repetition system, I want to create a product that serves as your personal learning assistant. Showing is better than telling, so here is what it looks like: <a href=\"http://www.helium-app.com/?utm_source=stackoverflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.helium-app.com/?utm_source=stackoverflow</a>. I don&rsquo;t want to make a cookie-cutter language app, I want to make a pedagogically-informed, intelligent and personalized learning app. This is the future of edtech.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>The feedback</strong></p><br /><p>In about five days we&rsquo;ve had 500 completely organic signups and tons of positive feedback. The average conversion rate is 20% (having excluded the first day which was mainly friends and family signups). People need this!</p><br /><p>Here is one:</p><br /><p>&ldquo;My name is James and I'm more interested in Helium than the average person. I've been learning Chinese for years, and this is something I've always thought needed to be made. But on top of that, I'm a developer as well, and really appreciate the work you must be putting into this app. Right now I'm living in China still trying to improve my Chinese, and this app is basically exactly what I need. I have plenty of friends here studying for the HSK test that would absolutely love it as well.&rdquo;</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s in it for you</strong></p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, chances are the opportunity to create something from scratch with massive potential impact together with smart and passionate colleagues is what gets you going. In addition to that, I will give you equity, and a lot of it, to make this thing happen.

Testers at Animoto are strongly embedded within product teams and partner with developers to increase confidence in our software. We are not trying to break systems that developers hand us, we&rsquo;re working with developers to deeply understand and improve systems. Want to become an indispensable member of the engineering team? Read on...<br /><br /><br />Test, as an engineering discipline, seems unusually vulnerable to existential crises. Every organization has a different perspective on test function, goals and deliverables. So we feel that a job posting needs to be fairly opinionated in terms of how we view &ldquo;Test&rdquo; at Animoto.<br /><br /><br />Fundamentally, we believe TESTING IS ABOUT GETTING FEEDBACK FROM A SYSTEM. This is true whatever size of system we&rsquo;re talking about, and whether we&rsquo;re talking about a developer feeding inputs to a single function in console or a suite of automated UI tests running in the cloud. Testing is obviously not something that only testers do, but members of the Test Team are mostly focused on providing feedback and working on systems that can provide feedback.<br /><br /><br />We try to avoid talking about &lsquo;Quality Assurance&rsquo;. This might just sound like semantics, but all teams need to care about quality and no one team can truly assure it. We value Automated testing and Exploratory testing. We do not write or run manual test scripts.<br /><br /><br />Our SDETs are capable developers who recognize that Test provides some of the most interesting and challenging engineering opportunities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>WHY YOU WANT TO WORK AT ANIMOTO?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><span>You resonate with our Test philosophy and don't want to work anywhere that doesn't think about Test in that way.</span></li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><span>You want a chance to learn and grow as a Test Engineer.
