We don&#39;t like big specifications or heavy planning processes; instead, we work on small projects, ship code frequently, and write tests. We&#39;re a built on a microservice architecture powered by Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, React, and we love to use new technology. Over 50 million unique visitors come to our sites every month.

What really matters is that it feels small. We work in small groups, each group has their own culture and vibe. And within those groups we work in teams, so working at Nedap feels a bit like working in a small company, but with big resources. The best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p>A little over fourteen years ago Nedap healthcare was born. Founded by a spirited individual that had an eye for simplicity and a drive for success, Healthcare&#39;s first product was a small time-tracking device for nurses with a single button. Hardware has always been in Nedap&#39;s DNA, evolving in the preceding eighty plus years from mechanical to electrical devices that started to include or be connected to more and more software.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, Nedap Healthcare builds mostly software, both for the web and mobile platforms. We help nurses, doctors, and patients manage their daily life by allowing them to focus on what is important.</p>\n\n<p>We are seeking a RoR engineer to tackle a complex migration project. Our core application has been built in Java and we have been slicing it into separate parts for a while now.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we have sliced away the front-end but we still rely on the Java app for most of the core data that drives the app. We retrieve this data using API calls. The next step is to access the data from within the RoR app without API calls (direct Mysql connection).</p>\n\n<p>The project will entail identifying the domain logic in the Java application (with our help) and moving that logic to Rails. The first step will keep the data storage in the \u2018old\u2019 datastore and access that database from within the Rails app. As a cherry on top, the RoR app is multi-tenant, but the old core app is single tenant.</p>\n\n<p>You need to be willing to temporarily re-locate to the Netherlands for the first leg of the project as you will need to interact with our engineers on the ground. After which the job can be continued remotely.</p>\n\n<p>Even though this is a single shot project, if all goes well there is room for you to join our team permanently if there is a good match.</p>\n\n<p>You need to have a very good grasp of Rails and Ruby but also be willing to dig into the old Java code to uncover the secret to what makes it tick. </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in helping us tackle this challenge please get in touch!</p>\n", "title": "RoR Engineer", "company_url": "https://nedap.homerun.co/", "post_url": "http://jobs.github.com/positions/6f0bd4d0-fd64-11e5-9e4a-79d6b673f93a", "source": "GitHub Careers", "location": "Groenlo, The Netherlands", "apply": "<p>Please apply using the following job form:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nedap.homerun.co/ror-engineer-data-migration/en\">https://nedap.homerun.co/ror-engineer-data-migration/en</a></p>\n", "data_created": "Fri Apr 08 08:37:01 UTC 2016", "company_name": "Nedap"}, {"full-time": true, "description": "<p><strong>Park Assist is looking for skilled C# .NET developers to work on our mission critical, high throughput, highly available web server application.
